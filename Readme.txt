Project Title
Text File Compressor.

Executive Summary
In our daily life we uses the text files often without considering the size and space consumption on memory, just because they are very small but on business or developing this space should be managed such that in training the model in Machine learning algorithm we uses large data set these kind of files are so large and we need to reduce the size of these files.
Our project i.e. text file compressing is project which compresses text files, reduces size of the file using Huffman encoding technique which in depth uses the greedy approach to implement the algorithm and to reach the output which is the unique and unambiguous binary or ternary code, depends on choice of tree. This was the most important functionality of the project but it only gives the compressed file but also provides the encoding of data in the text file. Then as every encoded files needs a decrypting algorithm this project will also implement the algorithm or logic for the decrypting of the encrypted data in the provided text file. Another edge this project will provide will be the availability as it will be a web based project user can access the application from anywhere with the access of internet. User will upload the file and can download the compressed version of the file and vice versa. 

Business Case

Business Outline
The most important benefit of the project is that it provides the encrypting which in turn enhances the security and it also compresses the file which reduces the size of the file on memory on large scales where data is stored in csv formats ectara. This will also decrypt the text file.

Motivation
In our daily life we encounter the space issue for the large text file size of training datasets in machine learning or in some cases where we uses csv files, these files should be small in size, this project will provide the solution for this kind of problem.

Target User
The target user can be from any person who wants to save some space in his computer or secure the text in the file to the large companies who want to compress large data files and the developers who want to save some space too.

Key Objectives
The key objective of the project is to develop a application which can compress and decompress the text files and also available to any person with access of internet.

Function Requirements 
Following are the some important functional requirements of the text file compressor:
•	As it is a web-based application so it should be accessible on internet.
•	User should be able to upload a text file on website.
•	User should be able to get the compressed text file.
•	User will get the encrypted text in the file after compression.
•	User should also be able to decompress and download the original file.
•	User should also be able to upload the .CSV files and get the compressed copy of the file.

Benefits
The only main benefits of the project would be space management as in older computer system where storage is a issue for user, user can compress the text file, another example would be the compression of the file of records stored by different companies. And another important benefit would be the privacy as it encrypts the file data.

Technology

Programming Language
Programming language used in this project is JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

Platform
This Project will be available on the web.
